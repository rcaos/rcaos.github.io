Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is `Jeans`, I am a software engineer located in [Lima PerÃº ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Peru)

I work in tech for more than 5 years, but since 2019 I focused on development of apps for mobile, specifically for iOS.

I'm concern about software quality, but at the same time I'm trying of optimize the development speed to increase the value of a business.

In this space I will share stuff and concepts related to the iOS world and software in general.

I hope you will find this information useful for you.

Enjoy. ðŸ“š ðŸ’ª
